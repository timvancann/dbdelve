//! The keybinding registry: every action a user can put a chord on, its
//! shipped default (if any), and the scope it fires in.
//!
//! `profiles.toml` stores only the overrides a user actually set, keyed by
//! [`KeybindingSpec::id`] -- a default that changes in a later build still
//! reaches anyone who never touched that row.
//!
//! Defaults are spelled `secondary-`, which GPUI reads as Cmd on macOS and
//! Ctrl everywhere else. `cmd-` would parse too, but it sets the platform
//! modifier, which on Linux is Super -- a key the window manager takes before
//! the app ever sees it. An override already on disk in the older `cmd-`
//! spelling still parses and still wins; it just carries that macOS meaning
//! with it.
//!
//! Rebinding takes effect on the next launch. GPUI's keymap can only be
//! replaced wholesale (`clear_key_bindings` then `bind_keys`), and clearing
//! it at runtime would also wipe the bindings `gpui_component::init` wires up
//! for its own widgets -- a risk this app has no reason to take for a
//! settings change nobody is in a hurry over.
