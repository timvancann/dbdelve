# Builds DBDelve for Linux and wraps it in a single-file AppImage: the same
# release binary, icons and desktop entry dev/package-linux.sh ships, laid out
# the way appimagetool expects and carrying the handful of libraries that are
# safe to travel.
#
# Bare appimagetool rather than linuxdeploy: linuxdeploy's whole value is
# working the dependency closure out for you, and that is precisely the part we
# do not want done for us. It copies everything ldd reports minus a blocklist,
# so getting to the split below means fighting it with exclude flags and
# hoping the blocklist it ships agrees with us next release. The set of
# libraries DBDelve may carry is short enough to state outright, and stating it
# outright is the only way a reader can check it.

# Which libraries ride along, and which must come from the host. Get this
# wrong and you get an AppImage that runs perfectly on the machine that built
# it and dies on every other one, so the rule is stated rather than inferred:
# everything ldd resolves is bundled except the families below.
#
#   glibc (libc, libm, libdl, libpthread, librt, libresolv, ld-linux)
#     Bundling glibc means the bundled loader and the host's NSS modules
#     disagree, and a mismatch there breaks DNS, users and locales rather than
#     failing to start. The build runs on Ubuntu 22.04 for exactly this reason:
#     glibc is forward-compatible, so the oldest build host is the floor.
#
#   GL, EGL, GLX, GLdispatch, GLES, glapi, gbm, libdrm, Vulkan loader and ICDs
#     These have to be the ones that match the running kernel's DRM driver.
#     A bundled libGL loads the build machine's Mesa against the user's
#     hardware, and an amdgpu box handed an AppImage built on an nvidia one
#     gets a black window or a segfault inside the driver. The host's Vulkan
#     loader finds the host's ICDs under /usr/share/vulkan; ours would not.
#
#   Xlib and the xcb core (libX11, libX11-xcb, libxcb.so.1, libXau, libXdmcp,
#   libbsd, libmd)
#     Excluded not because they are unsafe in themselves but because libGL
#     above drags them in, and a bundled libxcb loaded next to a host libGL
#     that expects the host's is how you get two copies of one connection
#     object in the driver. libbsd and libmd are here only as libXdmcp's own
#     dependencies, and shipping the dependency of a library we did not ship
#     is the same mismatch one level down. The xcb *extension* libraries --
#     libxcb-xkb and friends -- are not excluded and are deliberately not
#     matched by a wildcard here: they hold no state, they only marshal one
#     protocol extension onto whichever libxcb.so.1 is loaded, and they are
#     not shipped by default on a minimal system the way libxcb.so.1 is.
#
#   libwayland-egl
#     The EGL platform shim, half of the driver pair above. libwayland-client
#     is not: it speaks the wire protocol, which is versioned and stable.
#
# Everything else is fair game, because it talks to files and sockets over
# formats and protocols that do not care what kernel is underneath:
# libxkbcommon, libstdc++ and libgcc_s today, and fontconfig, freetype,
# libwayland-client and libdbus-1 the day a build stops linking them
# statically -- which is where they are now, vendored into the binary, so the
# loop below never sees them.
